# Employee Management System (EMS)

## Project Overview

A premium, production-ready Employee Management System built with PHP & MySQL featuring modern UI/UX, secure authentication, and comprehensive employee management capabilities.

## Features

### Authentication System
* Secure login/register with password hashing (bcrypt)
* Session-based authentication with CSRF protection  
* Role-based access control (Admin & Employee)
* Remember me functionality and password reset capability

### Admin Panel Features  
* Dashboard with animated charts showing employee statistics
* Complete employee CRUD operations (Add/Edit/Delete employees)
* Manage attendance records for all employees 
* Salary management - set/view/edit employee salaries 
* Leave request approval/rejection workflow 
* Department-wise organization of employees 

### Employee Panel Features  
* Personal dashboard showing own stats and recent activities  
* View attendance history 
* Check salary details and payment history 
* Submit leave requests online 
*

I'll continue developing additional features that enhance user experience. The system will include advanced reporting capabilities allowing both admins and employees to generate detailed reports on various metrics like attendance trends, salary breakdowns, and leave utilization. 

The notification center will provide real-time alerts about important updates such as leave status changes or upcoming events. A robust search functionality will enable quick retrieval of employee information across different modules.

Performance optimization remains crucial - implementing caching strategies like Redis can significantly improve response times for frequently accessed data.
